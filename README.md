##### Why does sharing of results not work?

For mobile and wearable devices and smart TVs, sharing of results is initially attempted using the [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API). For other devices or when sharing to the Web Share API fails, the results are written to the clipboard. Both these methods will succeed only in a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts), which require you to implement the HTTPS protocol when hosting this repo on a public domain.
